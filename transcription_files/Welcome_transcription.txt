 Hello there, my name is Harrison Bounds and I'm the creator of Notes.ai. Here is a test to see if the product is working. Notes.ai works by recording audio using the sound device library in Python. And from there it transcribes the audio into text using OpenAI's Whisper model. After that transcription is complete, Meta's LAMA model summarizes that transcription into an easy to read notes format in a markdown file. The component I am testing right now is a push to GitHub automatically after you have completed the recording process. This will be useful because after you have stopped recording, you can automatically save your notes in your GitHub account. I hope you guys enjoy.
